<b>1. PRELOADING ROOMS BEFORE EVENTS</b>

<p>
  Preloading popular rooms before events, especially battles, is a great way to speed up the process of switching rooms. Whenever you visit a room on CPA Battleground, it is automatically preloaded, meaning that the next time you visit that room, it will load much faster. So, if you visited most of the rooms in the game before the event, you will be able to switch rooms much faster during the event. This is especially useful for battles, where you need to switch rooms quickly to gain bonus points.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A few minutes before the event begins, visit as many rooms as possible.</li>
  <li>Return to the original room (or "pre-room") once you are done.</li>
  <li>You'll now be able to switch rooms faster.</li>
</ol>

<div class="tip">
  You can encourage other fellow attendees to preload rooms before the event starts. This way, everyone will be able to switch rooms faster. Even better, you could perform a small activity where individuals collectively switch rooms together multiple times in the pre-room before the event starts. This will ensure that everyone has preloaded the rooms!

<b>2. SEEING CPAJ ON A SECOND DEVICE</b>

<p>
  If you are an event leader who is also dealing with room switch announcements on CPAJ's Discord server, this trick might help. You require a second device, such as a mobile phone or a tablet, to see CPAJ while leading the event on your main device. This way, you can keep an eye on the room switch announcements without having to switch back and forth between servers on a single device. This is especially useful if you are leading via text, as you can quickly relay the room switch announcements to the event chat without missing a beat. Note that you will need to keep a track of time, as you might not receive push notifications or pings for battle updates when you are using Discord on another client.

<ol>
  <li>Keep an idle, second device physically next to you.</li>
  <li>Log into your Discord account if not already.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the correct battle updates channel in CPAJ Discord server.</li>
  <li>You'll now be able to keep track of both chats.</li>
</ol>
