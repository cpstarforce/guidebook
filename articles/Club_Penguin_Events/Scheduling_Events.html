<h2>Scheduling an Event</h2>

<p>
  First, you need to create a new Discord event through the <b>Events</b> tab on top of the server channel list. A pop-up will appear where you have to fill in some details regarding the event.

<ol>
  <li>Set the event location to the <span class="discord-stage-channel" channelId="1323220383566008350">Podium</span> stage channel. This ties the event to the Podium, making stage control easier.</ul>
  <li>Set the event topic to the name of the event. Some examples of event names are <i>AUSIA Training Event</i>, <i>Operation: Blackout</i>, <i>Practice Battle Against the Aliens</i>, and so on.</ul>
  <li>Fill in the correct event start date and start time in your device's time zone. This time should reflect the official starting time, and not the time when the preroom begins.</li>
  <li>Don't set an event frequency; keep the field as "Does not repeat".</li>
  <li>The description of the event could begin with the tagline of the event. Later in the description, you may optionally include extra information such as rewards, hints, or server and room info.</li>
  <li>We strongly encourage you to upload a cover image related to the event. If you have none for this event, use any Star Force-themed graphics, such as the Star Force banner itself.</li>
  <li>Confirm the event details and publish.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Now, post an event announcement in the next available event announcement channel. This channel is one of the three event announcement channels. Remember, event announcement channels are ordered in chronological order. If there are no other events scheduled, you can post the event announcement in the first channel. If there are other events scheduled, post the announcement in the one which is free. Make sure that the order of channels remain chronological, as that's the objetive of this event announcement channel system.
