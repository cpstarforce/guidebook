<h1>Leading Events</h1>

<p>
  Leading events on Club Penguin is not an easy task. It requires a lot of practice to become a good event leader. The Star Force provides plenty of resources to help you amp up your leading skills.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>
  Event leading involves two ways of communication — <b>text</b> and <b>voice</b>. At the Star Force, leading an event via text is compulsory, while leading via voice ("voice-leading" or "VC (voice chat) leading") is a side option. During an event, all staff members have the permission to send messages in the event chat, but only an appointed event leader can command the event and provide instructions. Event leaders who lead via text at an event are identified with the <span class="discord-role" color="#567C4F">Event Commander</span> role. On the other hand, event leaders who lead via voice are identified with the <span class="discord-role" color="#567C4F">Event Voice Commander</span> role. The event leader who is leading via voice is subordinate to the event leader who is leading via text, but the two individuals' opinions should be equally valued.
</p>

<p>
  The event chat is currently set as the main Discord server chat, <span class="discord-channel" channelId="1321447355354185793">general</span>. The voice chat used for voice-leading is <span class="discord-stage-channel" channelId="1323220383566008350">Podium</span>. The Podium is a stage channel, which means that only event leaders and SF Commanders can speak in it, while all other participants can listen. The event leader can also invite other staff members to speak in the Podium if needed.

  Occasionally, music might also be incorporated to enhance the atmosphere of the event by using music Discord bots. Music is typically played in special events, but can be played otherwise, too.

<h2>Checks</h2>

<p>
  Before the event begins, it is ideal to ensure the following…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you have complete details about this event?</li>
  <li>Have you appointed who is checking and announcing the rooms, if this event is a battle?</li>
  <li>Have reminders been sent to members who were interested in the event?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Make sure these checks are done before the event starts. If a check isn't done, you should do it right away, or ask a fellow staff member to do it for you.
</p>

<h2>Guidelines to Leading</h2>

<p>
  When leading a training event or a battle, consider the following guidelines to ensure the event runs smoothly…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a list of tactics ready and open on your screen.</li>
  <li>Use a balanced ratio of word tactics and emote tactics.</li>
  <li>Don't overuse <dfn name="Big Word Bubbles">big word bubbles</dfn> (BWBs); try to use them no more than 3–4 times in 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>A room typically lasts 10 minutes, unless the battle schedule says otherwise.</li>
  <li>In a battle organized with <dfn name="Club Penguin Army Judges">Club Penguin Army Judges</dfn> (CPAJ), any room switch announcements will be announced in the CPAJ Discord server.</li>
  <li>Request event attendees to open their maps 10–15 seconds before the minute the room switch announcement is made. After they open their maps, ask them to keep a tactic in their clipboard for the next room.</li>
  <li>When the room switch announcement is made in CPAJ, relay the news in the event chat. Then, ask attendees to paste the tactic in their clipboard in the new room.</li>
</ul>

<small>These guidelines are optional for some special or fun events, and usually mandatory for important events such as training events and battles.</small>
