<h1>Enlisting</h1>

<p>Enlistment is a fundamental part of our army. Without this process, recruiting is quite meaningless. Enlisting is the process of having a recruit create an account on CPA Battleground and officially consider themselves enlisted.</p>

<div class="info">
  Enlistment is only considered complete when a recruit is verified in the server, has created an account on CPA Battleground, and has been successfully activated by the game moderators.

<h2>Enlistment Requests</h2>

<p>
  An <b>enlistment request</b> is a message you send to a recruit to request them to enlist. This message is usually sent after a recruit has joined the server and has been verified. You can send an enlistment request by sending a direct message (DM) to the recruit. You don't need to be direct and straight away ask them to enlist; you can casually bring it up in the conversation. For example, you can say something like, "Hey! Welcome to our Discord server, would you like to learn more about us?" Create a smooth conversation elaborating what SF is about and then ask if they want to enlist. Remember, they will likely not know what the word "enlist" means, so you should explain it to them, especially if they ask.

<p>
  Please remember to react with the "ðŸ“¨" (<code>:incoming_envelope:</code>) emoji in their recruit log in the <span class="discord-channel">recruit-logs</span> before sending the user an enlistment request.

<h2>Completing Enlistment</h2>

<p>
  If they show interest in enlisting, you can send them a link to CPA Battleground or its sign-up page. You can also guide them through the sign-up process if they need help. You can inform them that they do not need to use a valid email address to create an account; fake email addresses are fine. After they give you a green light with their account creation, send the username to the <span class="discord-channel">account-activations</span> channel in the CPA Battleground Discord server. Let them know that they may need to wait for a few minutes to a few hours for their account to be activated.
</p>

<div class="info">
  Rarely, CPA Battleground may ask for additional information to verify the account. For example, they might need to know if the account was an alternate account [alt] or would like to tell you about a potentially inappropriate username. If this happens, you should get in touch with the Leadership. If the username is reported to be inappropriate, you should ask the recruit to recreate an account with a different, more permissible username.
