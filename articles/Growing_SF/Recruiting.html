<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>
  Recruiting needs some practice, but not much! It is a simple task that only requires time and patience. The objective is to find individuals who may be interested in joining SF and invite them into the Discord server. It is said that you have "recruited" someone once the recruitee has joined the server. There are multiple ways to recruit, including…
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Discord Scouting</b> — Searching for potentially interested users across public Discord servers. This is quick but has an unpredictable success rate.</li>
  <li><b>CPPS Recruiting</b> — Recruiting on <dfn name="Club Penguin Private Servers">Club Penguin private servers</dfn> is an old tradition in Club Penguin armies. It has its restrictions, but you'll likely find individuals who have genuine interest in Club Penguin.</li>
  <li><b>Social Media</b> — Posting adverts and featuring SF in places where you can, is useful to gain some recruits. This doesn't increase numbers much, but is long-term and time-saving.</li>
  <li><b>Word of Mouth</b> — Asking your real life friends or family members to try out Club Penguin armies through SF is often a good option. Perhaps, you could even foster a real life relationship through such a connection, if done well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some methods may be faster, while some may be more powerful; it is entirely your call to choose what methodology for recruiting you should go with. We are ready to offer you support and guidance for any method you choose! Remember, do not spam or harass users while recruiting. Always be respectful and courteous to others.

<h2>Discord Scouting</h2>

<p>
  Discord Scouting is the most common method of recruiting among Club Penguin armies. It involves searching for users who may be interested in joining SF on Discord.
</p>

<b>1. CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT</b>

<p>
  You may be interested in creating a new Discord account for the purpose of recruiting. This is not necessary, but it is recommended to keep your personal and recruiting activities separate and to prevent yourself from any penalties from Discord due to massively messaging users. If you require a new email address, you can create one for free using services like Gmail or ProtonMail. Once you have a new address, you can create a new Discord account using that email.
</p>

<p>
  If you're creating a new account, you should also consider setting up a profile picture and a username that is appropriate for recruiting. Generally, recruiters build attractive fashion profiles to gain attention. For example, some may pick anime-themed avatars or portray a different gender. At the end, don't make your account appear like a spam user. You can still add the SF server invite link in your profile bio safely, though.
</p>

<b>2. JOIN RECRUITING SERVERS</b>

<p>
  Join a populated Discord server on your recruiting account where you will be recruiting members from. Here are a few recommended servers with their estimated member counts that you can join…
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/minecraft">MINECRAFT</a> — 2,000,000 members</li>
  <li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/roblox">Roblox</a> — 1,250,000 members</li>
  <li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/fortnite">Fortnite</a> — 1,300,000 members</li>
  <li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/valorant">Valorant</a> — 1,500,000 members</li>
  <li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/genshinimpact">Genshin Impact</a> — 2,200,000 members</li>
</ol>

<div class="danger">
  You should never recruit users who are already in another army. This is considered <dfn name="Troop-stealing">troop-stealing</dfn> and may lead to conflict with other armies and a diplomatic fall. Troop-stealing is widely frowned upon in the community. To prevent this, you should join army servers then check whether the individual you're recruiting is already in another army. If they are, you should not recruit them.
</div>

<b>3. BEGIN MESSAGING</b>

<p>
  You have two ways to recruit users on Discord. The first is to instantly send direct messages (DMs) to users, and the second is to talk in the server's chat humanly and later send out direct messages. You can try the method that you feel most comfortable with and see which one works best for you. Remember, you should not sound robotic or spammy; sound human, natural, and casual. You should also avoid writing long messages or use too many emojis. Don't fit too many sentences in a single message throughout a conversation.
</p>

<p>
  To send a direct message to a user, head to the DM channel. You could begin by sending the Wumpus wave sticker. Then, you could say something along the lines, "Hey! I saw you in the server and thought you might be interested in joining a gaming group. Would you like to check it out?" You can have imperfect punctuation in your sentence for the better. It is encouraged that you don't simply give the invite link away, as you might be seen as spam. It is good to have a conversation with the user first, and then send them the invite link if they show interest. You can also ask them about their interests and hobbies to make the conversation more engaging. This builds a hands-on approach, and you might even end up playing a video game with them! Such recruits are more likely to retain in the community and become part of the more active members.
</p>

<p>
  Don't wait for their response, instead, move on to the next user. If they don't respond, you can try sending them a follow-up message after a few minutes. If they still don't respond, you don't need to put extra effort on bringing them up, as they'll be less likely to be interested. Remember, not everyone will be interested in joining SF, and that's okay. You should not take it personally and keep trying with other users. Depending on the source and personality of your recruits, your recruiting performance can vary.

  As soon as you send your starter message (i.e., a waving sticker), don't wait for them to respond. Move on to the next user while they see your message. If they respond, continue the conversation with them.
</p>

<b>4. TALKING IT THROUGH</b>

<p>
  Talking is an important stage while recruiting. If you're social, this may be quite easy for you. If they show interest in joining SF, you can send them your invite link to the server. Once they join, make sure to verify them as soon as possible. You'll learn more about verification in the <a onclick="client.load.article('articles/Growing_SF/Verification.html')">Verification</a> article. You can also ask a fellow staff member to help you with the verification process to make duty smoother. After they are verified, welcome them in the main chat and try to continue the conversation in the server instead. Don't forget to start their enlistment process for them later. You'll learn more about enlisting in the next article on <a onclick="client.load.article('articles/Growing_SF/Enlisting.html')">Enlisting</a>.
</p>

<div class="warning">
  Right now, <b>the verification system is disabled</b>! So, you won't need to verify recruits or find someone to do that for you. You can simply welcome them in the main chat as they'll be automatically verified.
