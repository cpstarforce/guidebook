<h1>Verification</h1>

<p>
  Verification is the process of giving access to a user to most of the SF Discord server. In recruiting, this is a crucial step. It is the one of the final steps in the recruiting process, and it is done after a user has joined the server. Verification may help in maintaining the integrity of the server, preventing spies, and correctly assigning roles to newcomers.

<div class="warning">
  Right now, <b>the verification system is disabled</b>! So, you won't need to verify recruits or find someone to do that for you. You can still read this article to learn about the verification process, but you don't have to, at the moment.

<p>
  By standard, any new user who joins the server is considered a newcomer, regardless of whether it is a <dfn name="Visitor">visitor</dfn> or a <dfn name="Recruit">recruit</dfn>. When the verification system is enabled, verification is entirely manual and only a moderator can verify a user. Moderators are expected to quickly fill in and verify newcomers, especially recruits. It is important to verify recruits as soon as possible, so that they do not lose interest and leave the server for good.

<h2>Who to Verify</h2>

<p>
  You should verify newcomers who match one of the following criteriaâ€¦
</p>

<ul>
  <li>are recruits invited by a verified member</li>
  <li>are visitors</li>
  <li>are not likely spies or observers from other armies with bad intentions</li>
  <li>are not individuals with inappropriate profiles</li>
  <li>are not likely spam bots</li>
  <li>are not impersonators of any individual at the Star Force or in Club Penguin armies</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Verify</h2>

<p>The much recommended method is to use the <code>.verify</code> command. This command works for users with various role combinations, allowing the roles to be set depending on what roles the person may already have. This is also guaranteed to work, as long as the Star Force Bot is up and running.</p>

<p>If you are a High Command member, you have the <b>Manage Roles</b> permission. If you cannot use the <code>.verify</code> command, you can manually set roles. You can also use <span class="slash-command">verify</span> by supplying the required <code>user</code> and <code>action</code> actions. Please make sure you do this carefully without any errors! Note that the Sapphire bot will intervene when you update roles manually to help you correctly set the roles. To verify a recruit, simply remove the Unverified role. To verify a visitor, remove the Unverified and Recruit roles, and add the Visitor role. Sapphire will handle the rest!</p>
