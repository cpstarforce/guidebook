<h1>Growing SF</h1>

<p>
  Growing the Star Force is a crucial aspect of maintaining its vitality and ensuring its continued success. This involves recruiting new members, enlisting them, and training new the comrades in the world of Club Penguin armies. Consistent growth is necessary, otherwise an army can stagnate and lose its relevance.

<p>
  Star Force has <b>three important tasks</b> that are quintessential for its growth…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Recruiting</b> — Inviting new members to SF
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Enlisting</b> — Integrating recruits into SF by having them create a CPA Battleground account
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Training</b> — Empower enlisted SF members with battle skills
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These tasks are super important because they are what makes an army possible. Without recruits, there are no members to enlist, and without enlisted members, there is no one to train. And without training, there is no one to fight in battles. So, these tasks are the foundation of not just Star Force, but any army.
