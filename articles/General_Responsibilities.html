<h1>General Responsibilities</h1>

<p>This page articules the usual responsibilities each member of the Star Force staff team has to practice during their tenure at SF.</p>

<h2>List of responsibilities</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Chats should be civil and respectful. Don't tolerate racism or hate speech at all, and show little leniency in such cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    All server rules should be enforced, including <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord Community Guidelines</a>. As a moderator, you need to take these rules seriously. This means that you should periodically check the rules channel and ensure that you are familiar with them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternate accounts [alts] are allowed in the Discord server, but it would be ideal if alts could remembered or noted in advance. So, always be curious about the owners of alt accounts. If you feel an account is suspicious, you should share the knowledge with other moderators.
  </li>
  <li>
    All staff members are expected to remain fully informed at all times. This means, as a staff member, you should be able to provide insight to any recent update when asked. There is a staff chat, so you are expected to utilize it and stay updated with any discussions in there.
  </li>
  <li>
    Communicate well. If you encounter a direct message with content that is threatening or important to the army, you should share it with other fellow staff members. Don't quietly watch the fire!
  </li>
  <li>
    Never leak any war plans, whether potential or scheduled. This includes insight to invasions and raids.
  </li>
  <li>
    Participate as much as possible. You should show enthuasiasm by reacting to announcements, pressing the "Interested" button on scheduled events, and promoting events casually in the main chat. These simple acts can boost your chances of promotion significantly compared to other methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is imperative to be active in the server and participate. If you are inactive for a long period of time, you may be demoted or removed from the staff team.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never share any personal information about other members of the server. This includes, but is not limited to, their real name, age, location, photos of their face or body, and any other private information. If a larger issue requires the sharing personal information with fellow moderators, you should discuss it with the Leadership first.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please do not reveal the name of the moderator who took any moderative action against a member, unless you have permission from the Leadership or the moderator!
  </li>
  <li>
    Please do not post sensitive or discreet content from any staff-only channels in any public channels or direct messages with unrelated members.
  </li>
  <li>
    We are actively banning members with an unacceptable personality, regardless of whether it is related to SF or any of its members. For example, pedophiles, rapists, and child abusers will be banned immediately and permanently. These bans are not appealable, unless the member is able to prove that they are not guilty of the crime.
  </li>
